# PiViewer
PiViewer: an open-source tool for automated detection and display of pi-pi interactions.
The aromatic ring perception and the pi-pi interaction identification is implemented by using Python, NumPy, and the python wrapper library of OpenBabel. PyMOL is selected as the main GUI for the 3D display of protein/ligand molecular structures and the pi-pi interactions as it is a popular open-source molecular visualization system and supports python for module/plugin development. The entire function can be installed as a PyMOL plugin.
